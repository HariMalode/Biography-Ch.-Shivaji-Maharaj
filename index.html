        <h4>
            <p>Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj (19 February 1630 – 3 April 1680) was a Maratha warrior king and the founder
                of the Maratha Empire in western India. They are considered one of the greatest warriors in Indian
                history and his military tactics are still studied in military academies worldwide.<br><br>
                Ch.Shivaji Maharaj was born in the Shivneri Fort near Pune. Their mother, Jijabai, played a crucial role in
                their upbringing, instilling values of courage and righteousness in them from an early age.<br><br>
                In 1645, Ch.Shivaji Maharaj acquired Torna Fort, marking the beginning of their military endeavors. Over the
                years, they went on to capture several forts, including Raigad, Pratapgad, and Sindhudurg.<br><br>
                Their crowning as the Chhatrapati of the Maratha Kingdom in 1674 marked the formal establishment of their
                rule. Ch.Shivaji Maharaj not only excelled in military strategy but also demonstrated exceptional
                administrative skills. They promoted a decentralized administration, ensuring effective governance at
                the local level.<br><br>
                Ch.Shivaji Maharaj's naval expertise led to the establishment of the Maratha Navy, a significant force in
                the Arabian Sea. They built Pratapgad Fort to defend against the Adilshahi forces, showcasing his
                strategic foresight.<br><br>
                Despite facing challenges from the mighty Mughal Empire, Ch.Shivaji Maharaj established a Maratha kingdom
                that lasted for centuries and laid the foundation for the Maratha Confederacy. They Were a visionary
                leader who valued religious tolerance and had a deep respect for all faiths.<br><br>

        <h4>
            <p class="bs"><br>"A king should never fall into the clutches of another, and should he do so, he should
                strive to get rid of his situation, even at the cost of his life."</p>
            <p class="bs"><br>"It is the function of the king to kill, to punish, and to frighten, so that those who
                do evil should be afraid."</p>
            <p class="bs"><br>"One must not be influenced by the inherent nature of a place; instead, one must be
                undeterred in carrying out one’s duty."</p>
